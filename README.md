# `Tesla` Mobile Office 🚗 🖥️ 🧑‍💻

Creating this repo
means I can't "hide"
what car I drive ... 🙄
Promise I'm _super_ frugal
in _most_ other areas of my life.

# Context

When we lived in London and Edinburgh,
we cycled everywhere
and/or used public transport if it was raining too much.
Similarly, when I lived and worked in 'Murica,
walked or cycled everywhere
only getting a Taxi or renting a car
when we needed to cover a large distance.
I only got my driving license when I was **`28`**
because I didn't _want_ to waste time on cars.

## _Owning_ Cars

`while` I
[_love_ cars](https://github.com/nelsonic/nelsonic.github.io/issues/284)
I realized early on (aged `~16`)
that cars are a _huge_ liability (cost)
that has to paid each month; 💸
fuel, insurance, cleaning & maintenance aren't "free".
So unless you _need_ a car
e.g: transport for work,
avoid having one if you can!
At least until your
investment income exceeds your monthly expenses.

## `Toyota IQ`

In 2015 I bought a (second hand + low milage)
[`Toyota IQ`](https://github.com/nelsonic/nelsonic.github.io/issues/10#issuecomment-105060692)
(€6.5k)
for my parents to have a _reliable_
low fuel consumption ultra-easy to park vehicle.
The `IQ` stayed in `PT`
as we _definitely_ didn't need it in `LDN`
Inês and I used it occasionally when we visited `PT`.
I continued cycling every day in `LDN` until we left.
Meanwhile parents upgraded their (unreliable) car
to a newer, but used, `Hyundai` so no longer needed the `IQ`.
So when we moved from `LDN` to `Braga` we used the `IQ`
when we needed to travel longer distances.

## _Children_ 👶

For the first year of our son's life we use the `IQ`,
it was adequate because it's a 3.5 seater.
One parent would sit in the back
while the other sat in front with the baby seat + baby.
This worked for most cross-country family-visit trips
but we knew it couldn't last forever.
So we began researching a bigger vehicle ... 🔍

## Electric? ⚡

Burning fossil fuels for day-to-day transport
is an _insanity_ that was normalized by
wealthy petroleum entrepreneurs/executives
spending fortunes on marketing it.
[`Petroleum`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum)
is a **_finite_ resource**;
once it's all burned,
it's **gone for _ever_**!
It took _millions_ of years to form
from fossilized organic materials.
Organic materials that absorbed energy
from sunlight during their life
either through
[photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis)
or by _consuming_ plants - or other animals -
which derived their energy from the sun.

I made it clear above that
before we got our _electric_ car
we drove a gasoline `Toyota`.
Refueling with _non-renewable_
[fossil fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel),
each time was a constant pain. 😢
We could _easily_ afford the price of fuel -
which we all _know_ is too _chea_ because it does not factor the
[externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality) -
the pain was due to knowing that it's unsustainable,
to 





## Solar Panels ☀️

As soon as we owned a _roof_ where we could place
[solar panels](https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/20),
we invested in them _immediately_.
Yes, the cost continues to decline
and efficiency improves
with each new generation,
but that's the same for _every_ technology!
You don't avoid buying a Laptop
because there will be a "better" one next year.
You just get on with the investment
and _use_ the laptop to make more money!

The price of panels has almost _halved_
since we got our **`32`** panels in
[**`2019`**](https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/20#issuecomment-528205287)!
But in these 5 years
we have _easily saved_ 70%
of the money we invested
on our electricity bills.
They haven't fully payed for themselves _yet_.
Mainly because we also bought a few batteries
to store the excess energy on high-yielding days.
We've had near-zero maintenance costs -
just the occasional panel pressure washing -
to ensure the glass is clean
to maximize yield.

## Tesla? 💭

When we ordered our `Tesla Model 3`
it was _by_ far the best value-for-money
electric vehicle
for longer journeys (i.e. 400+ km range)
with a good ("super") charging network
and excellent crash-test safety record.
We bought ours second-hand from Germany
